# 3DReconstruction
3D modeling of organs based on medical images (CT, MRI ...). The modeling is done using computer graphics algorithms.

I am using a transperancy based approach to enable us to see specific parts of the organs (for example only bones or only tissues).

The model enables us to see planes that doesn't exist in the original images.
